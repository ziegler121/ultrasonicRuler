# Ultrasonic ruler for measuring building interiors using Arduino

+ This project is to aid in measuring the distane of objects from a reference point without the use of a ruler
+ To keep a safe distance from harmful objects, an ultrasonic sensor was employed in measuring the distance from an object and then a buzzer (alarm) is sounded if the distance is too small
+ LEDs also light up accordingly to indicate closeness to the object
